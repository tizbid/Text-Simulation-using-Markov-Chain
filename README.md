# Text-Simulation-using-Markov-Chain

* Markov Chain are mathematical system that transitions from one state to another following a set of probalistic rules. [read more](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/)

  Here I used it in a text similation: 
  
* Words from quotes were randomly seeded in pairs to form a 50 quote. 
* As expected at each run the result is largely a meaningless group of words that lack proper structure. 
* Applying a more deterministic approach like increasing the "n-word" seeding sequence produces a better result.
