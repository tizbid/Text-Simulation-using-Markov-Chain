# Text-Simulation-using-Markov-Chain

* Markov Chain are mathematical system that transitions from one state to another following a set of probalistic rules.
  Here I used it in a text similation.
* Words from quotes were randomly seeded in pairs to form a 50 quote. At each run the result are largely a meaningless
  group of words that lack proper structure. 
* Applying a more deterministic approach like increasing the "n-word" sequence produces a better result.
